        <h2>About Latoya</h2>
       
        <p>
          I have arrived at a point in my <b>journey</b> where the only thing I am
          seeking is peace. Everyday, every action that I take is lead by a very
          strong desire to have more quiet and peaceful moments than chaos and
          noise. I am an avid hiker and enjoy the yoga classes. My current
          profession is a Chef. I find it to be too chaotic and rough on my body
          so I have chosen to go back to school so that I can find a job that
          allows me to rest my body more than being active. It's only fun to be
          active now when it's something that brings me health benefits.
        </p>
       
        <p>
          I have two children. My son is 18 and works at Electric Boat and my
          daughter is 17. She is very athletic playing volleyball and basketball.
          Being a parent working full time and attending school full time is
          probably the most chaotic thing ever, but I see an end goal here so it
          keeps me going.
